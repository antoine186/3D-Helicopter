## 1) Assembly of Helicopter Compound Body Collider Using Capsule Colliders

The Helicopter compound body collider is made of an assortment of resized, displaced, and rotated capsule colliders. Without those, dropping the helicopter from higher up would result in it falling through the base plane of the game world. The individual pieces of the compound collider are the fuselage, tail, mast, left skid, and right skid.
The mass of the R22 helicopter is set to 1 default.
